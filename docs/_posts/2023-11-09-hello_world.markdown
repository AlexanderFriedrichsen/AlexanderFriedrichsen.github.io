### My First Blog Post

# Lots of experiementing with formatting
_i'm trying to remember markdown syntax_
~~it's going well~~
__Knock on wood__

Today I set up this blog site. Installing Jekyll wasn't too too bad. Actually felt like I was some dev things for the first time in a while.
After all, how much of being a dev is actually coding, how much is reading docs and installing packages? (it depends)

One thing I like to do is make lists:
- To do lists
- reflection lists
- lists of lists to make
- meta lists
- in my head
- l
- i
- s
- t
- s
- NOT sharepoint lists

I do want to figure out a good conduit for my thoughts, and sometimes paper seems irreplaceable. Thus it must be transferred if I want this blog to be truly authentic. I'm not sure to what extent the blog should be structured, the kind of content I will release, etcetera. I can only imagine the expansive, highly trafficked, world of the honestAF blog, full of instructional deck guides, poker videos, fantasy worldbuilding, piano sheets, and whatever else my mind has to offer. It's kind of like my notion page, but for the world to see.

Does anyone want to see?
I'm not sure if I care about the answer to that question...

# What is the "AF" in honestAF
One, it's my initials, Alex/Alexander/Xander Friedrichsen.
Two, it's __AS FUCK__, because we like to be fully blatantly honest.
Some rationale, allegorically ([can an allegory be quantitative? random article I haven't read yet.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/465587)):
I am playing a combo deck that has 51% against the field. The combo is linear, uninteractive, and results in many nongames.
I am playing a control deck that has 49% against the field. The deck feels like it is always in every game it plays. It interacts and has lots of agency.
Obviously, the combo deck is superior from a spike's view. If I am trying to win the tournament, I chose combo deck (let's say CI is +- .001%).
Being Honest can feel like playing the combo deck - you might sometimes get reactions that are more visceral and polarizing, but will result in a net positive.
Being ~~dishonest~~ the social chameleon can result in a twisting and turning style that may make you party to none.
Contextually, it is murkier. But I can say whatever I want in my blog, and philosophically I identify with this.
Hypocrisy be damned, let's examine that later.

Lastly, here is a picture of the deck I have been playing, taken from Jaberwocki due to his incredibly consistent results.
