# It's Saturday Baby

Woke up and played the historic open last chance on arena. Chose the deck that took the least wildcards - UR Wizards. Very strong deck - Symmetry Sage is quite the card! Took 4 attempts to get there, BO1 is definitely dieroll format with all the UR mirrors. Kethis surprised me at 5-0, didn't know what the deck was and took the game. Not sure if I could've let Emry live that game...

Going to go to a pong tournament tonight. For charity, my friend Gavin's third time hosting. You wouldn't think that crazy mf had the organizational skills, but I am pleasantly surprised each time.

Went into a luxury Yamaha store today and played a beautiful baby grand.
