Played a ton of Lost Caverns of Ixalan (LCI) draft the past two days, and just fininshed building my sealed pool in a sealed RCQ
I took 1/4 the time, but I had a historic qualifier to play. Plus, UB was obvious.

Historic Qualifier: UR Wizards
R1 : lost to RB creativity, misplayed g2 should've left up gust + pierce. 0-2, 0-1
R2 : otp against mirror 2-0, 1-1
R3 : concede due to 2nd round of RCQ starting. Wow that lost EV...

RCQ Report

2-0 into 2-3, needed 3-2... Format feels very prince, lost to bombs and screw.
