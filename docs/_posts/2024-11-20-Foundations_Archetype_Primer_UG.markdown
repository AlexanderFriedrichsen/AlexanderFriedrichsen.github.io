# MTG Foundations Draft Guide: Color Pair Analysis and Winning Strategies

## Introduction
Magic Foundations brings us back to fundamentals with a core set-style draft environment focusing on two-color archetypes and battlefield-centric gameplay. We have escaped the haunted, convoluted rooms of Duskmourn. Now, it's time to slam a serra angel on 5 and hope it sticks.

Or slam a doubly well fed craw wurm on 6 - *I'm looking at you, Quakestrider Ceratops*

While I am certainly a proponent of complicated board states and intricate card interactions, it's refreshing to draft a set that doesn't ask too much, while bringing with it some of that cozy nostalgic feeling we all look for.

Strategically, here's what I've found about foundations so far:

## Draft Priorities
1. Premium removal - another set where efficient removal is king.
2. Archetype-specific payoffs - signpost uncommons and synergy rares are what underly great decks.
3. Efficient creatures - know which ones are more generalist to a color, and which are more niche.


Without further ado, let's take a peak at what's been winning! These decks are taken from the 17Lands repository of trophy decks for best of 3, found at this link: https://www.17lands.com/trophy_decks. Included here are images of only one deck 3-0, but the takeaways are synthesis of information from several decks.

## Analysis Framework
For each color pair, I'll examine:
1. Archetype gameplan
2. Sample 3-0 deck
3. Overperformers
4. Strategy

### Exceptions
- It is possible to build UW heavier blue, leaning into tolarian terror and draw synergies.

## UW
### Gameplan
The UW deck functions as a classic "skies" strategy, combining efficient flyers with ground defense and tempo plays.

### Sample 3-0 Deck Analysis
![UW 3-0 fliers](\assets\images\2024-11-20\UW_3-0.png)

### Overperformers
- Luminous Rebuke
- Felidar Savior
- Dazzling Angel
- Healer's Hawk

### Strategy Tips
- You can usually block if you want, they usually can't block you. Be flexible and try to judge if you are the aggressor.
- Stall the board with creatures that have big butts or gain life (Aegis Turtle, Felidar Savior, etc.).
- Prioritize 2-3 mana flyers over expensive ones.
- Interaction for the most efficient threats will let you race against the less efficient ones.
- Lifegain will help race.
- typical 9-8 manabase, very little splashing

## UB
### Gameplan
The UB deck operates on a controlling axis while sometimes pivoting to a tempo gameplan.

### Sample 3-0 Deck Analysis
![UB 3-0](\assets\images\2024-11-20\UB_3-0.png)

### Overperformers
- Bake into a Pie
- Think Twice
- Burglar Rat
- Eaten Alive
- Infestation Sage

### Strategy Tips
- Dreadwing Scavenger is a very powerful signpost that can utilize gy synergies as well as find your bombs.
- Eaten Alive is good without fodder, but even better with.
- Flashback spells alongside looters help generate card advantage
- Macabre waltz can help rebuy your bombs even if you have to discard them early.
- Some decks utilize a heavy spell count (fleeting distraction, stab, refute) alongside tolarian terror effectively.
- Very little splashing


## UR
### Gameplan
UR wants to get a threat early and then play card draw and efficient removal while pushing damage.
### Sample 3-0 Deck Analysis
![UR 3-0](\assets\images\2024-11-20\UR_3-0.png)

### Overperformers
- Bigfin Bouncer
- Think Twice
- Burst Lightning
- Fleeting Distraction
- Thrill of Possibility

### Strategy Tips
- High density of two drops with a low curve
- A good izzet deck will spend all its mana every turn of the game
- Decks can be fragile, as if they remove your pinger, or you draw the pinger after casting spells, you lose a lot of value needed to close games.
- However, there are multiple builds of izzet that require very specific cards - tokens and burn are some of the more out there options!
- Playing a two drop and then protecting it or killing all their threats while accruing value is a viable win condition.
- Can sometimes play control if you have a lot of cheap removal that lines up well, plus card draw.


## UG
### Gameplan
UG is one of the weaker color pairs, and part of this is due to the identity being slightly noncohesive. The archetype is present as a UG ramp, but in practice the set rewards curving out so heavily that your ramp threats can't always catch you up on tempo enough to recover. Heavy into either green is where you want to be.

### Sample 3-0 Deck Analysis
![UG 3-0](\assets\images\2024-11-20\UG_3-0.png)

### Overperformers
- Llanowar Elves
- Bite Down
- Uncharted Voyage
- Wary Thespian

### Strategy Tips
- Try to be a heavy green deck splashing blue for cards like Uncharted Voyage and Think Twice, or Tatyova
- Don't try to be solely ramp, like playing multiple copies of Grow From the Ashes
- The exception to the above is if you have several splashable bombs and a UG base. This is harder to do than in past sets.

## BW
### Gameplan
BW is a strong color pair that focuses on life gain and fodder creatures, sometimes goign wide and sometimes playing an attrition game.

### Sample 3-0 Deck Analysis
![BW 3-0](\assets\images\2024-11-20\BW_3-0.png)

### Overperformers
- Squad Rallier
- Dazzling Angel
- Helpful Hunter
- Vampire Soulcaller
- Luminous Rebuke

### Strategy Tips
- Repeatable card advantage and mana sinks are often hard to find in BW. Squad Rallier is both of these, and your deck should often by nature fit its requirements.
- Cards like Ravenous Amulet and Vampire Gourmand offer sacrifice outlets that generate card advantage from your cats and rats.
- As per usual, efficient removal is paramount through cards like Eaten Alive, Stab, and Luminous Rebuke.
- Unlike some of the other archetypes, the commons here go relatively deep, meaning you won't often struggle for playables.


## BG
### Gameplan
Another weak color pair, BG is supposed to cneter around the morbid mechanic. Mechanics like these sometimes struggle in a synergy based set because they usually just happen through playing the game normally and cna't be hard built around. BG this set is no exception, and it plays like a good stuff archetype typically.

### Sample 3-0 Deck Analysis
![BG 3-0](\assets\images\2024-11-20\BG_3-0.png)

### Overperformers
- Evolving Wilds
- Bushwhack
- Bake into a Pie
- Treetop Snarespinner
- Dwynen's Elite

### Strategy Tips
- When I draft BG I look for card power level and intersperse synergies, contrary to other color pairings in the set.
- Two-for-one effects are a must to make up for subpar synergy.
- I like deck that have many permanent type cards alongside regrowth effects. It's a sad day when you have to play your elvish regrower as a vanilla 4/3 because you only played spells so far.
- Because BG cares about power level so much, it is also a great candidate for splashing bombs (alongside green's fixing). This makes fixing like evolving wilds and dual lands a bit better in BG. Evolving wilds is the highest winrate common in the archetype, in fact.
- Mana sinks are another way to generate card advantage and Treetop Snarespinner is one of the only options at common.


## BR
### Gameplan
BR is deceptively not so much about attacking with the raid mechanic. It should be played more as a midrange and sacrifice deck that generates value while chipping damage.

### Sample 3-0 Deck Analysis
![BR 3-0](\assets\images\2024-11-20\BR_3-0.png)

### Overperformers
- Hungry Ghoul
- Gutless PLunderer
- Burst Lightning
- Gorehorn Raider
- Involuntary Employment

### Strategy Tips
- The classic steal your guy, smash, and sac is back and better than ever(?). Sometimes, this effect can assuage having fewer "hard" removal spells.
- This archetype likes several cards that other black decks aren't quite as interested in, so you may see them go later.
- Gorehorn Raider is not quite Flametongue Kavu, but it's pretty close.
- There isn't a one size fits all gameplan for RB, be adaptable on whether you want to attrition, or need to squeeze damage.

## GW
### Gameplan
Counters, but your spells still resolve. Go big, or go wide, but distribute carefully. GW is a high synergy archetype.

### Sample 3-0 Deck Analysis
![GW 3-0](\assets\images\2024-11-20\GW_3-0.png)

### Overperformers
- Banishing Light
- Treetop Snarespinner
- Bite Down
- Healer's Hawk
- Inspiring Paladin

### Strategy Tips
- Like BG, mana sinks are rare and the Treetop Snarespinner fills that role nicely.
- Healer's Hawk is one of the best targets for +1/+1 counters, and can make racing impossible for the opponent. It's unassuming, but will often eat a removal spell.
- Watch for Claws Out when playing against GW (or any heavy white deck).
- Many of the GW bombs are absolutely game ending, but even without the generic powerlevel and the prominence of decently statted creatures makes GW both potent and consistent.

## GR
### Gameplan
The gruul mechanic is based on power 4 or greater, but like GB, this is usually something you don't have to work to hard for.

### Sample 3-0 Deck Analysis
![GR 3-0](\assets\images\2024-11-20\GR_3-0.png)

### Overperformers
- Wary Thespian
- Treetop Snarespinner
- Beast-Kin Ranger
- Ambush Wolf
- Cackling Prowler

### Strategy Tips
- GR can feel a bit clunky if you don't prioritize early curve plays as there are many 4-5-6 mana creatures to chosoe from.
- There aren't many ways to make your big creatures harder to block (trample, menace) at common.
- GR removal is almost all conditional based on toughness, so think twice before killing an early threat that isn't immediately goign to take over the game.
- Try to figure out if you want to board stall and win in the air later with big dragons, or tradeoff and win on the ground.
- Both Ambush Wolf and Beast-Kin Ranger can fulfill the 4 power requirement easily.

## WR
### Gameplan
WR is good ol' straightforward go wide tokens aggro. It relies heavily on synergy.

### Sample 3-0 Deck Analysis
![WR 3-0](\assets\images\2024-11-20\WR_3-0.png)

### Overperformers
- Dazzling Angel
- Hare Apparent
- Felidar Savior
- Fleeting Flight
- Prideful Parent

### Strategy Tips
- If you want to be the Hare Apparent drafter at the table, WR is the best color pair to do it in (and it's actually pretty strong when it works).
- Heroic Reinforcement is a bomb uncommon and can kill out of nowhere. Having more than 1 copy is the nuts in WR.
- While going wide is the modus operandi, WR can still utilize the 4 power requirement red creatures relatively well and house with bigger threats too.
- Fanatical Firebrand is a bit too smallball (I found this card hard to evaluate at first glance).

## Color Pair Tier List
1. UW 
2. BW - BR - UB
3. GW - GR - RW
4. GB - UR
5. UG

## Conclusion
Foundations rewards fundamental Magic skills, but a skilled player still has the tools to beat variance and come up on top most of the time. Drafting is more straightforward than usual given restrictive splashing and focused color pairs. Focus on curve, removal, and synergy over complicated combinations. Take on color dual lands highly. Gain an edge through knowing your gameplan, deck construction post draft, and playing towards your win condition.
