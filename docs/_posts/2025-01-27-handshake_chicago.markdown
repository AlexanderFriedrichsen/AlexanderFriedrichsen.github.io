### Chicago PT 2025:  Tournament Reflection
## What Went Right
# Personal Performance

Successfully balanced social energy with focus and necessary recharging periods
Maintained a moderate exercise routine throughout the event
Adhered to a reasonable sleep schedule
Kept dining budget on target (~$220) while enjoying quality food and house meals
Utilized time efficiently for testing while maintaining healthy habits (eating, napping, reading)

# Team Collaboration

Pre-tournament planning at the house allowed us to refine numerous ideas
Successfully coordinated with Moxfield and managed sponsorship activities for the team
Made the best of merchandise challenges

# Tournament Results

Advanced to Day 2 despite difficult starts
Recovered to an even record through intentional mental adjustment
Felt confident in deck selection and draft preparation

## Areas for Improvement
# Preparation

Need more repetitions with the chosen deck before future tournaments
Should test specific sideboard cards more thoroughly (practicing by putting cards directly into hand)
Develop methods for faster testing:

Assemble more paper decks or proxy decks
Find alternatives to MTGO which proved too slow this time



# Tournament Performance

Aim for slightly faster pace of play
Draft strategy became too greedy in the second draft; should deviate less from plan, especially in high-power packs

# Physical Wellbeing

Improve sleep quality during tournament days by:

Better controlling room temperature
Addressing snoring issues
Implementing a calming pre-sleep ritual to reduce stress
Entering room earlier to shower and get to bed sooner
Completing all tasks the night before (no morning todos)
Optimizing timing of pre-tournament meals
Including appropriate exercise the day before



# Team Dynamics

Meetings were excessively long and unfocused
Need a designated leader to maintain meeting efficiency and focus discussions
Delegate presentation control more effectively
Some team members were unwilling to try all decks or dismissed options based on personal preference
Should give more credit to deck builders to encourage innovation

# Mental Approach

Break out of stimulus-response patterns by incorporating more reflection/meditation
Focus on high-efficiency testing and reducing panic as deadlines approach
Regularly meditate on the "Most Important Question" at each stage

# Professional Presentation

Jerseys arrived late
Need to update social media during tournaments
Take more photos for content
Dress more professionally (pack more appropriately)
Improve personal marketing and narrative generation

# Logistics

Better manage food options during the second half of tournament days
Retire earlier the night before events
Reduce consumption of sugary foods at the team house
