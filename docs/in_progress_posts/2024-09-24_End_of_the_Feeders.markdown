The past eight weeks' weekends were a haze of frantic cubing. Ultimate Guard arranged the first Vintage Cube: Live!, an in person vintage cube draft where you get to keep the cards. The MTGO vintage cube we all played with online with has a slightly different list from the one used in the event, but it was ensured the total price of cards in the cube would be $60,000. Not bad, eh? I didn't make the weekend finals of the event, but I did get to watch as my friend Slax won with the most generic mono green deck one of the weeks, and Juju bean (and co.) showed everyone that they are the best cuber at the time of this writing.

The structure of the event was insidiously addictive, I found. As someone who likes high-stakes Magic, the urge to get up and play from noon to 4 am while the feeders were open was strong. I learned that setting boundaries is important with my playing. In the future. Probably. That's how it usually goes, right? Magic hooks you for a period of time.

Skip forward to October, and I'm on the flight on my way to Las Vegas for Worlds. This year has moved fast and Worlds has come sooner than I imagined. I've prepared in a more focused way for this tournament than ever before, allowing my obsession to flourish. I want to do well, to prove myself. It says something that I feel the need to prove myself in this arena. Of course, it is the highest level of competition. As a member of Handshake, I feel like I am doing my part in the testing process. But working with the best makes me hyper-conscious of my shortcomings as a player. I need to get faster. Make fewer mistakes. Maximize my EV. I have learned from my first time testing with Handshake in Amsterdam what I need to be prepared. I need my sleep in a cold room. I need to exercise the days leading up to the event, and not overeat or eat like shit. I need to have played enough of the constructed format that I am intimmately familiar with my deck, and the piloting of the opposing deck. Not only will this help me make savvy plays, it is a large factor in play speed. Lastly, I need to have confidence in my own ability. I am confident. I am clear. I am here.

One thing I can't decide is how mcuh going all in helps from a mental standpoint. Say I play Worlds, but convince myself that even if were to do poorly, I would be able to fall back on knowing getting a job is the real task. Avoiding the crushing knowledge that you tried wholeheartedly and failed requires bravery. Moreover, I struggle to rationalize going all in as correct in other ways. Diversification leads to opportunities that you wouldn't otherwise know exist. Don't want to get stuck maximizing a local optima, right? The needle in a haystack problem is a way of framing there exists a payoff that is much more profitable than the rest but equally likely to be found in an (infinite) set. Ignorance is bliss? Time to start the O(n) search.
